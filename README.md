# Notes application in React
## Description
This small notes application developed using React allows users to organize and manage their notes. The project leverages the capabilities of React Markdown, React Bootstrap, and local storage. <br /><br />
The creation of this project is motivated by my technical blog hosted on [Hashnode](https://blog.danylkecha.com/react-notes-app). I have published a blog post that offers a detailed step-by-step guide covering every aspect of the project, beginning with the initial setup and concluding with the final version of the application. <br /><br />
This tutorial intends to provide a comprehensive resource for readers interested in learning and implementing a similar notes application using React.<br /><br />
